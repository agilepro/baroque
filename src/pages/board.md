# Board of Directors

## Artistic Director (vacant)

The Santa Cruz Baroque Festival’s founding Artistic Director, Linda Burman-Hall, died suddenly on August 21 while attending a conference in Malaysia. It was her vision and boundless energy that has allowed SCBF to present excellent, historically informed performances of early music to the Santa Cruz community for decades. 

Even as we begin a search for a new Artistic Director to take the helm for the 2025 season, we dedicate the 2024 Season to Linda and her legacy. We invite you to participate in this recognition and celebration by renewing your financial support of SCBF. The first concert of the Festival will be followed by a reception for donors that will feature remembrances of Linda from those who knew her best.
