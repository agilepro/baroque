# Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Statement

At the Santa Cruz Baroque Festival, we believe that music is a powerful force that unites people from all walks of life. Our commitment to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion is fundamental to our vision of creating a vibrant, inclusive, and transformative musical experience for all.

**Diversity**: We celebrate the rich diversity of our community and the global music landscape. We highlight the global exchanges that have shaped musical history, bringing to light multicultural undercurrents that are often ignored by music festivals.

**Equity**: We are dedicated to providing equitable opportunities for artists, audiences, and participants from all backgrounds. We strive to break down cultural barriers that have dissuaded marginalized groups from fully engaging in and benefiting from the festival experience. 

**Inclusion**: We aim to create an inclusive environment where everyone feels welcome and valued. This means actively seeking out and incorporating diverse perspectives in our planning, programming, and decision-making processes. We want every attendee, performer, and partner to feel a sense of belonging and ownership in the festival.

## Our Actions

1. **Inclusive Programming**: We will continue to present a diverse lineup of performers and concert themes that showcases the ways early European music was influenced by and influenced folk and indigenous music from non-European cultures. 
2. **Community Engagement**: We will build meaningful partnerships with local organizations, schools, and community groups to ensure our festival is accessible and relevant to the diverse communities we serve.

3. **Accessible Experiences**: We will implement measures to ensure our festival is physically and economically accessible to all, including offering student discounts, a policy of free admission to first-time SCBF attendees, ADA-compliant facilities, and free community events.

4. **Evaluation and Accountability**: We will continuously assess our DEI efforts, soliciting feedback from our community and using data-driven insights to improve our practices and policies.

At the Santa Cruz Baroque Festival, we understand that our journey towards greater diversity, equity, and inclusion is ongoing. We are committed to listening, learning, and taking meaningful action to ensure that the joy and power of early music are accessible to all.
