Jacques-Martin Hotteterre (1674-1763), the foremost member of the great French dynasty of renowned Baroque woodwind instrument makers, players and composers, told the world his secrets on how to play the wooden flute (France's most popular instrument) as well as how to improvise successfully in his 1707 Opus 1 treatise.

Now three centuries later, with Hotter Jazz as the music of our own time, we apply Hotteterre's improvisational ideas creatively in jazz style, working from similar foundations.

Eventually all sound-streams lead to Bach, whose name in German literally does mean ‘stream', the joining of cooperating currents flowing confidently and with force. Our all-transcriptions concert takes place in candlelight, while the metaphorical light we shine on familiar works is quite new. Expect to hear Bach with new ears. Perhaps the most famous Bach organ work, the D Minor Toccata and Fugue, known for more than 250 years as an organ work, is heard now as it might have been conceived, as a work for unaccompanied violin.

An on-site meet-the-artists reception follows for fully vaccinated donors and season ticket holders.
