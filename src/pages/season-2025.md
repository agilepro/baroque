# 2025 Season Concerts


## Rendezvous with the Romantics

Welcome to Santa Cruz Baroque Festival's 52nd season. We are delighted to announce that our distinguished Artist in Residence from last season, Maestro Jörg Reddin, has accepted the position of new Artistic Director for the 2025 season. Maestro Reddin thrilled our audiences last year with his mastery of the pipe organ, his rich bass-baritone voice, and his skillful conducting. For 2025, in addition to presenting four contrasting concert programs we will cohost a fundraising event at the German Cultural Center of Santa Cruz and two concerts with limited admission at private homes. In addition, Maestro Reddin will once again offer a Master Class for vocalists and oversee our annual Youth Competition, this year also for singers. 

It's going to be an amazing year for Baroque music and some other surprise selections! We encourage you to purchase a season pass to save on individual ticket prices and ensure that you don't miss any of these special events. Last year several of Jörg's concerts sold out. Individual as well as season tickets may be purchased in advance on our website [https://scbaroque.org/](https://scbaroque.org/) and also at the door, space permitting.

Please consider donating to Santa Cruz Baroque Festival. We need your help to sustain the quality of musicians and venues we have been able to offer for over 50 years.
